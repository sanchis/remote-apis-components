<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
The idea of this project is to make the most of the capabilities of module federation. The idea is to create components using public apis. Currently the apis that are being used are the following.

Feel free to add or improve any functionality. I will review all proposals and bugs as soon as possible.
